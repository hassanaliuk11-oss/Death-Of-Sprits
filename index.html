                We walk through crowded streets yet feel the hollow echo of nothingness`

                Walking through life with eyes that no longer see the hidden magic`

                desc: "A hollow vibration travels through the empty halls of the ancient house...",
                content: `The sound of a soul leaving remains in the cold morning air
                A hollow vibration travels through the empty halls of the ancient house
                We hear the ghost of a laugh that once filled the room
                The spirit has gone but the memory still haunts the silent stone
                Every footstep we take triggers an echo of someone no longer here
                The air feels thin as if the essence has been sucked away
                We are listening for a voice that has been lost to time
                The wind carries a melody that nobody can truly remember or sing
                It is the sound of a dream that died before it woke
                A vanished spirit leaves a footprint in the dust of the mind
                We follow the trail but it leads into a thick grey mist
                The echo is a reminder of the beauty we failed to keep
                We reach out for a shadow that disappears when we get close
                The spirit was a fire that left only a cold black mark
                We are tracing the lines of a story with no final page
                The silence is not empty but filled with a ghostly ringing sound
                It is the vibration of a string that has snapped in half
                We feel the presence of a void where a heart once beat
                The echo grows faint as the years wash over the broken shore
                We are searching for the source of the sound in the dark
                But the spirit has traveled beyond the reach of our mortal ears
                The world feels lighter yet more lonely without that heavy golden spark
                We are talking to walls that have forgotten the names of kings
                The echo of the spirit is a map to a hidden grave
                We dig in the sand but find only the white bleached bones
                The spirit was the water and we are the dry cracked earth
                We hear the rain falling in a dream that never comes true
                The echo is a cage made of the things we never said
                We are trapped in the resonance of a long and final goodbye
                The vanished spirit is a star that exploded a million years ago
                We see the light but the fire is already dead and gone
                The echo is the only thing left of a once great king
                We are the servants of a palace that has no living master
                The sound of the spirit is a whistle in a deep canyon
                It bounces back but it is not the same voice anymore
                The echo is distorted by the walls of our own many fears
                We are afraid of the quiet that follows the final fading note
                The spirit has crossed the river leaving us on the muddy bank
                We hear the splashing of oars in the middle of the night
                But there is no boat and there is no ferryman to see
                The echo is a haunting of the things we took for granted
                We realize the value only when the air becomes perfectly still now
                The vanished spirit is a bird that has flown into the sun
                The song remains in the trees but the branches are all bare
                We are collecting the echoes in a jar of broken thick glass
                They cannot be held and they cannot be heard by the world
                The spirit was a secret that the universe decided to take back
                We are left with the riddle and no way to solve it
                The echo is a pulse in the wrist of a dead hand
                It is a trick of the mind and a trick of time
                The spirit was the light and the echo is the long shadow
                We are walking in the shadow looking for the sun behind us
                The echo is a bridge that leads to a place of ghosts
                We are afraid to cross but we cannot stay on this side
                The vanished spirit is a perfume that lingers in a velvet dress
                The person is gone but the scent makes the heart ache so
                The echo is a letter written in ink that fades in light
                We read the words but the meaning is lost to the wind
                The spirit was a giant and we are the tiny crawling ants
                We live in the footprint of a soul that has walked away
                The echo is the sound of a door closing in the distance
                It is the finality of a life that has reached the end
                We are waiting for the echo to stop so we can sleep
                But the spirit is restless and the sound will never truly die
                The echo is a seed that falls on a bed of rock
                It cannot grow but it refuses to be turned into dust today
                The vanished spirit is a cloud that has turned into thin air
                The sky is blue but we remember the shape of the storm
                The echo is a mirror that reflects the sound of our grief
                We are crying out to a heaven that is busy with others
                The spirit was the truth and the echo is the beautiful lie
                We believe the lie because the truth is too hard to bear
                The echo is a chain that binds us to the very past
                We must break the sound to find the silence of the peace
                The spirit has vanished into the great and the infinite golden sea
                We are the ripples that remain on the surface for a while
                The echo is the end of the story of the human soul
                We are the ones who must listen to the very last breath
                The spirit is gone but the echo is ours to keep forever
                It is the music of the dead and the song of life
                The echo is the proof that we were once truly alive together
                We will join the spirit when our own echo finally starts now`
            },

            Title 4: Beyond the Breath: The End of Being
The final air leaves the lungs and returns to the wide sky The lungs become still like a bird that has finished its flight There is a moment of peace when the struggle finally ends now The body is a heavy anchor dropped into a deep silent sea We move beyond the rhythm of the rising and the falling chest The heart stops its drumming and the blood turns into cold stone Being is a flame that has used all of its flickering oil The light goes out and the smoke drifts into the dark night We are more than the skin and the bone and the meat The essence escapes through the mouth like a soft white winter mist The world of the senses is left behind like an old coat We can no longer feel the heat or the bite of cold The thoughts that once raced are now quiet like a frozen lake The end of being is the start of a much longer journey We cross the border where the maps have no more printed names The ego dissolves like a sugar cube in a glass of water There is no more I or me in the vastness of space We are part of the atoms and the dust of the stars The breath was the string that tied the soul to the earth Now the string is cut and the balloon flies into the sun The memories of a life are flashing like a dying light bulb Then there is only the grand silence of the very infinite We are moving beyond the need for words and for spoken names The struggle for power and for gold is a distant tiny joke Being was a temporary mask worn for a very short play today The curtain has fallen and the actors have gone to their rest The end is not a wall but a window to the unknown We look through the glass and see the truth of the universe The breath was a loan that we had to pay back eventually The bank of life is closed and the ledgers are all balanced We are floating in a void that feels like a warm hug The fear of death is a shadow that disappears in the light Beyond the breath there is no pain and there is no sorrow The heavy burden of the self is lifted from the tired shoulders We are like a drop of rain falling into the great ocean Individual identity is lost in the blue of the deep spirit sea The clock on the wall has no power over the timeless soul We are living in the space between the seconds of a dream The end of being is the ultimate freedom from all the chains We do not need the eyes to see the glory of God The spirit is a traveler that has finally reached the front door The key is the silence that comes after the last long sigh We are dancing in a place where there is no gravity at all The music is the vibration of the entire created world of light Beyond the breath there is a garden with no dying flowers now The sun never sets because the light comes from the inside out We are meeting the ones who left the party before we did The end of being is a homecoming for a very weary child The body was a cage but the spirit was always the bird The door is wide open and the sky is a deep blue We are breathing the air of a world that has no pollution The soul is a diamond that has been polished by the life Now it shines with a brilliance that we cannot even imagine here The breath was a cage that kept the light from spreading far The end of being is the expansion of the mind into space We are everywhere and nowhere at the same exact time today The physical world is a shadow of the real world beyond us We were dreaming of life but now we are truly awake forever The silence is a song that we have always known the words Beyond the breath there is no time and there is no space We are the pulse of the stars and the heat of suns The end of being is the beginning of the great eternal life We are the weavers of the dream and the dream itself now The body is a memory that the earth will slowly eat away But the spirit is a flame that can never be put out We are moving toward the center of the big bright white light The breath was the first step on a very long winding road The end is the destination we have been seeking for so long We are free from the hunger and free from the deep thirst Beyond the breath there is only the truth of the holy love We are the energy that moves the planets in their round orbits The end of being is a transition into the pure holy spirit We are shedding the weight of the world like a dead skin The soul is a fire that burns without any wood or coal We are the light and we are the dark and everything between The breath was a whisper in the middle of a loud storm The end is the quiet after the wind has died down now We are sailing on a ship with no sails and no oars The current of the universe is taking us to the distant shore Beyond the breath there is a peace that passes all understanding We are the ones who have finished the race and won gold The end of being is the greatest mystery of the human heart We are finally home in the arms of the great creator now
       
      : The Architecture of Emptiness
Emptiness is not a hole but a structure of pure silent potential We build the walls of our ego to hide the vast vacuum The soul is a cathedral built around a center of absolute nothingness We decorate the interior with gold to forget the hollow truth inside True wisdom is understanding the space between the pillars of our thoughts The architecture of the self is designed to contain the uncontainable spirit We are afraid of the void because we cannot own its silence Every room in the mind is a box meant to trap light But the emptiness is the only thing that is truly eternal here We spend our lives filling the gaps with noise and useless things The master architect knows that the beauty is in the open space A cup is only useful because of the empty part in middle Our being is a vessel waiting to be poured into the infinite The structure of our grief is built on the foundation of loss We walk through the corridors of a heart that has no furniture The emptiness is a mirror that shows the true face of God We are trying to map a territory that has no solid ground The architecture of silence is the highest form of human prayer now We must dismantle the roof to see the stars of the truth The void is not an ending but the source of all creation The blueprints of the soul are written in the ink of silence We are the architects of our own internal and lonely prisons today The bars of the cage are made of our very own desires To be empty is to be full of the entire breathing universe The walls are falling down and the wind is blowing through us We are becoming the space that holds the sun and the moon The architecture of emptiness is the freedom from all defined shapes We are the house and the guest and the empty room together The spirit breathes best when there is nothing left to hold onto We are the architects of a temple that has no solid walls The emptiness is the solid rock upon which we must now stand Deep philosophy is the art of unlearning the world we built here We are returning to the state of the original and holy void The structure of our life is a shadow of a higher emptiness We are the ones who must live in the house of no-thing The architecture of the spirit is the science of the inner space We are finding the home that we never really truly left behind The emptiness is the only bridge to the heart of the one
